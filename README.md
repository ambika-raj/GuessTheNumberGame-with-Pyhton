# Guessing Game

Welcome to the **Guessing Game** project! This is a simple Python program where you try to guess a number between 1 and 100.

## How the Game Works:
- The computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100.
- You enter your guesses, and the program will tell you whether your guess is too low, too high, or correct.
- The game continues until you guess the correct number.
- Once you guess correctly, the program will tell you how many attempts it took.

## Features:
- Handles invalid inputs (like letters or numbers outside the valid range).
- Keeps track of the number of attempts.
- Provides hints to guide the user in guessing the number.
